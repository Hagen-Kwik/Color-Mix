WWDC 2023 Submission

Welcome to Color Mix,
Color Mix is a playground project that I created using swiftUI to simulate color mixing for my submission in Apple WWDC 2023. In this application you will get to know the basics of color theory and get a direct hands on color mixing. By using the Primary colors and green, users combine any colors to create their very own color. After Creating it, they will also be able to get their colors hex so that they can use it somewhere else.

How to Play?

1. Below are your initial color options, to use the color, double tap on the color and the color will appear on the canvas/free space above.
2. After having multiple colors on the canvas, drag the color and drop them on top of each other. If the color collides each other upon dropping, the new color will appear on screen and you can mix them with another color again.
3. To delete a color on the canvas, drag and drop them to the trash icon on the bottom right corner
4. To see the color hex you have created, press on the color
5. Keep in mind that you can only have up to 10 colors (the circles) on the canvas.

Features and Technology Used:

In this app I used mainly swiftUI for the cosmetics and view. For the color mixing itself, I used UIColor library to play with colors component, RGB values to be exact. Lastly, for drag and drop, I used the gesture library (for drag and drop) and CGPoint library (for coordinates) .
Note: All Libraries are original from swift
